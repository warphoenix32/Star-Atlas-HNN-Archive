## Blocking decisions

None for the closed written-recovery milestone.

## Closed decisions

- `REVIEW-PHASE2-RAW-RECOVERY`: `CLOSED_SELECTED_SCOPE_COMPLETE`. Aephia, HNN, and Official are complete at 541/541 selected records. Five Herald pilot captures are preserved; the remaining 254 Herald records are deferred by the operator.

## Deferred, non-blocking decisions

- `REVIEW-6E92B789AF1CEAB2`: observed Discord handle `Michael` remains unmerged with Michael Wagner, per operator decision `DEFERRED`.
- `REVIEW-A2599BBFBEA526F5`: display tag `EMP` remains unresolved, per operator decision `DEFERRED`.

## Decisions to surface before destructive cleanup

- Whether to delete the 44 remote topic branches already merged into `main`.
- Whether to retire `operations/migrations/validate_wave_1_5.py` or preserve it in a clearly historical location.
- Whether source-like campaign captures should move from `operations/` into `archive/raw/`; any move requires manifest and checksum migration.

These decisions do not block the evidence baseline. No deletion or relocation is performed by Phase 1 inventory.

This directory is the operational source of truth for the seven-phase Archive → Knowledge → Library roadmap. GitHub remains authoritative for the underlying evidence and campaign work.

At every campaign closeout, the Lead Coordinator updates the program status and any affected coverage, campaign, dependency, backlog, and human-adjudication records. A campaign that does not affect a field records `NO_CHANGE`; it must not silently leave the roadmap stale.

The detailed evidence baseline is maintained in [`../../coverage/`](../../coverage/).
