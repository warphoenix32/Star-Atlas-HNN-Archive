# Lore Repository Ingestion — 2026-07

This campaign preserves and normalizes the public `JoseEduardonoot/star-atlas-lore` repository as an operator-designated authority for Star Atlas lore taxonomy and preferred nomenclature. The Archive remains the system of record.

## Authority boundary

The authority designation is limited to in-universe taxonomy, classification, and preferred names. It does not make the upstream repository an ATMTA publication, independently verify every narrative claim, or override non-lore governance and historical evidence. The upstream repository metadata describes the project as fan-created, while the `main` branch and deployed site use an "Official Star Atlas Lore Encyclopedia" description. That identity discrepancy is preserved for review.

The campaign uses the immutable `main` commit `22555f277eb1496e34c0839c8f1f382842bd1d2b`. The repository default branch was `master` at capture time, but the live site was deployed from the separate `gh-pages` branch. All branch and deployment identities remain explicit in provenance.

## Processing model

1. Preserve the commit-pinned GitHub source archive and live-site inventory captures.
2. Inventory every repository file and every Markdown page.
3. Treat `canon/**/*.md` as the upstream canonical authoring corpus.
4. Treat `docs/**/*.md` as the published presentation layer, recording exact, divergent, missing, and presentation-only mirrors.
5. Preserve but exclude `c4-internal/**` working material from canonical lore normalization.
6. Normalize page metadata, headings, links, media references, taxonomy, source-local entities, and evidence-bound reference relationships.
7. Produce compatibility mappings for existing Archive lore IDs without rewriting historical evidence.

Text normalization is deliberately mechanical: UTF-8 BOM removal, LF line endings, trailing line-whitespace removal, and one final newline. The immutable commit archive retains the upstream bytes and remains the authority for exact historical wording and formatting.

## Identifier policy

- Page Source IDs are deterministic hashes of the upstream scope and repository-relative path.
- Lore taxonomy entity IDs use the `LRTX-` namespace. They are source-taxonomy identifiers, not allocations from the repository-wide canonical entity registry.
- Existing Archive lore IDs remain unchanged and are connected through the taxonomy migration mapping.

## Schema compatibility

Repository Schema v2.1 broad entity types remain unchanged. The normalized lore layer adds a controlled `lore_type` refinement. For example, `SPECIES` refines `COMMUNITY`, `FACTION` refines `ORGANIZATION`, and `PLANET`, `WORLD`, `SECTOR`, and `STAR_SYSTEM` refine `LOCATION`. The explicit compatibility map is stored in `archive/normalized/lore/taxonomy.json`.

## Deterministic commands

```text
python operations/campaigns/lore-repository-ingestion-2026-07/build_campaign.py
python operations/campaigns/lore-repository-ingestion-2026-07/validate_campaign.py
```

The builder reads only the preserved commit archive and the two preserved live-site captures. It performs no network access.

## Review boundaries

- No `knowledge/`, `graph/`, or `publication/` file is changed.
- No upstream wording is rewritten.
- Broken upstream links, divergent publication mirrors, unresolved identity mappings, missing licensing metadata, and embedded workstation paths are documented rather than silently corrected.
- This campaign is archival ingestion only. Claim-level semantic promotion requires a later reviewed campaign.
