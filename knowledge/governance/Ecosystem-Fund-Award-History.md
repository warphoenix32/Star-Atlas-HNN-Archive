# Ecosystem Fund Award History

This registry records PIPs that the captured proposal and Council data identify as Ecosystem Fund funding authorizations. “Award” is used narrowly: the proposal passed and was eligible for the fund. It does not mean money moved, deliverables were accepted, or the project succeeded.

## Policy boundary

[PIP-4](../../archive/source-records/social-governance-semantic-enrichment/governance/SRC-PIP-04-AD1945D8.json) created the original framework. [PIP-23](../../archive/source-records/social-governance-semantic-enrichment/governance/SRC-PIP-23-0ECF2928.json) later replaced it in full, preserving a separate Ecosystem Fund wallet, a 20% allocation formula, a USD 500,000 USDC reserve rule, USDC-denominated requests, ATLAS payments, a 5% proposal ceiling tied to the last refill balance, and a 12-month maximum project term.

PIP-23 is policy and refill authority, not a recipient award. PIP-33 is excluded because its primary text requests a direct DAO Treasury authorization and the Council tracker marks `ecosystem_fund: NO`.

“Complete,” “partial,” and “terminated” above are Council-authored operational labels, not independent findings. Mixed USDC and ATLAS values are not added or converted because the record does not establish whether they represent separate transfers, valuations, or tracker-entry conventions.

## Rejected applications, not awards

PIPs [15](../../archive/source-records/social-governance-semantic-enrichment/governance/SRC-PIP-15-BD065AD2.json), [19](../../archive/source-records/social-governance-semantic-enrichment/governance/SRC-PIP-19-1EB3D15E.json), and [26](../../archive/source-records/social-governance-semantic-enrichment/governance/SRC-PIP-26-B70AC545.json) failed. They belong in proposal and failure history, not the award registry.

## Research protocol

For each authorization, the evidence chain must be reconstructed as proposal amount and denomination → vote result → Foundation/Council implementation instruction → transaction → recipient → milestone submission → acceptance → outcome. A missing link remains explicit; later marketing or tracker summaries do not fill it automatically.

## Missing artifacts

Each authorization still needs its transaction signature, block time, source and recipient wallets, mint and decimals, exact amount, dated conversion basis where relevant, milestone package, acceptance record, termination or completion instrument, and outcome evidence. PIPs with mixed USDC and ATLAS tracker fields additionally need source-native accounting records that explain whether the values are transfers, valuations, or duplicate representations.

## Review status

`QUALIFIED`, risk class `R3`. Authorization identity is generally well supported; the payment and outcome layer remains largely unreconciled.
