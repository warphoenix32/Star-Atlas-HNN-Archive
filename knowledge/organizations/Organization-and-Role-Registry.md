# Organization and Role Registry

This registry separates institutional identity from office, delegation, individual service, and current-state claims. It complements the stable [Entity Registry](../index/Entity-Registry.md): the Entity Registry supplies identifiers, while this page dates roles and records evidence limitations.

## Core institutional entities

| Entity | Type | Supported role | Authority boundary | Current-state qualification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [ATMTA, Inc.](ATMTA.md) | Operating company | Product developer/operator and official publisher associated with Star Atlas | Not the DAO electorate, Foundation, or Council | Corporate structure and full leadership chronology incomplete. |
| Star Atlas brand/ecosystem | Public identity/ecosystem | Umbrella for products, lore, communications, and institutions | Not a legal entity inferred by this archive | Use only where a narrower publisher or institution is unavailable. |
| [Star Atlas DAO](../governance/Star-Atlas-DAO.md) | Governance system/electorate | Locked-POLIS, PVP-weighted proposal voting | Passage does not execute code, transfer funds, or prove outcome | Formal charter captured in PIP-1; current participation distribution unresolved. |
| [Star Atlas Foundation](../governance/Star-Atlas-Foundation.md) | Legal/administrative body | Governance administration, legal/compliance mediation, and safe/lawful implementation within captured rules | Not an independent legislature; may decline unsafe implementation under stated conditions | Current officers, signers, and delegated duties require dated records. |
| [Star Atlas Council](../governance/Star-Atlas-Council.md) | Elected governance-process steward | Author assistance, process operations, delegated program administration, and Council-authored assessments | Not a sovereign legislature; tracker assessments are not independent verification | Only first elected roster is resolved in archive. |
| Ecosystem Fund | Bounded treasury mechanism and wallet | Finances eligible passed proposals under controlling policy | Not the entire DAO Treasury or a separate organization | PIP-23 controls captured policy as of review date. |

## Constitutional role chain

| Role | Holder type | Evidence of role | What must remain separate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Proposal author | Person or organization | Named in a PIP | Authorship is not approval. |
| POLIS voter | Address/controller with locked POLIS/PVP | Vote record | Address does not establish personal identity. |
| Foundation administrator | Institutional body/delegate | PIP-1/PIP-2 and later operational record | Administration is not voter sovereignty. |
| Council steward | Elected individual acting through Council | Election result plus service evidence | Election is not proof of uninterrupted current service. |
| Program recipient | Person/organization named by funding PIP | Proposal and recipient record | Authorization is not payment or completion. |
| Product developer/operator | ATMTA or another evidenced organization | First-party publication, repository, contract, or corporate record | Brand association alone is insufficient. |
| Publisher/replay publisher | Publication, account, or channel | Source metadata | Republishing does not transfer original authorship. |

## Council roster states

PIP-6 identifies twelve first-round advancing candidates and must not be treated as the elected roster. PIP-7 identifies the first final Council members: `jp`, `funcracker`, `king_bryan`, `bodhi_tree`, and `drumcarl05`. Later election PIPs 11 and 25 have unresolved winner identity in the captured archive. [Council Election History](../governance/Council-Election-History.md)

The registry therefore uses:

- `ELECTED_FIRST_TERM` for the PIP-7 final roster, without claiming present service;
- `ADVANCED_NOT_ELECTED_BY_THIS_STAGE` for PIP-6-only candidates;
- `WINNER_IDENTITY_UNRESOLVED` for PIP-11 and PIP-25;
- `CURRENT_ROLE_UNKNOWN` where no dated service evidence exists.

## Identity collision controls

- Star Atlas Council is not the lore Council of Peace.
- It is not the Ustur Security Council or Dark Matter’s “Dark Council.”
- Hologram News Network, The Hologram, and Kr1gs are distinct publication/brand/person identities.
- Town Hall and Atlas Brew are distinct event formats.
- Star Atlas TV/VBTV can be a replay publisher without originating an event.
- ATMTA publication does not merge ATMTA with the Foundation, DAO, or Council.

## Role-ledger schema for future records

Each role entry should preserve `organization_id`, `actor_id`, source-native title, normalized role, role state, start and end values with precision, source IDs, authority class, conflict notes, and `as_of`. Historical, intended, elected, appointed, acting, departed, and current states must not be collapsed.

## Missing artifacts

Priority acquisitions include ATMTA corporate filings and ownership history, Foundation incorporation and current officers, multisig signer records, Council seating/resignation/replacement notices, election 2/3 results, staff appointment/departure announcements, formal delegation instruments, and original publisher/replay metadata for recurring events.

## Review status

`QUALIFIED`. Core institutional boundaries are high confidence; individual and current role chronology is incomplete.
